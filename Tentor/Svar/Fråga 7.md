- **Packet loss**  
	**Affects:** Reduced reliability, increased latency and decreased bandwidth.  
	
	**Mechanisms:** Uses a window size to control the amount of data being sent by fixing it to a certain size.

- **Duplicate Acknowledgement**  
	**Affects**: Unnecessary retransmits, increased latency.  
	
	**Mechanisms**: Sender uses a counter for the amount of Ack’s it’s receiving. If the counter reaches a certain threshold it retransmits.

- **Congestion ** 
	**Affects**: Reduced reliability, increased  
	latency and risk for packet loss.  
	
	**Mechanisms**: “Slow start”. Sender starts by sending small amount of data and increases it until congestion. It then decreases the window size to continuously transmit data.
