- **Link state:**
  Link state is a centrelized aproach where the whole network is known when setting up the weights/costs
  Example protocol: OSPF
- **Distance vector:**
  Distance vector on the other hand is when network nodes only are aware of its neighbors
  Example protocol: GPG

- **Static routing:**
  Is when you manually sets up a network connections/weights. This could be preferred if the network is small and you know that it wont change.
- **Dynamic routing:**
  Dynamic routing algorithms automatically set up the networks connections/weights and can switch the routs of one path is overloaded. This also means it easy to add new nodes to the network.
  This is preferred in bigger networks where changes often happen

- To easily recognize packets
- To equaly divide resources

*Sequence numbers* are introduced to ensure data order and identify duplicate packets, while *timers* are used to manage timeouts and retransmissions for unacknowledged packets.
